# Web MIDI playground

A little Web MIDI playground for testing and evaluating connecting a browser to a DAW and using Javascript to control it.

In my case I used Windows and Bitwig.

- Create a virtual MIDI port using loopMIDI.
- Start Bitwig which auto-detects the port as a controller. Or at least it did in my case; you may need to add it manually.
- Start the playground: https://op12no2.github.io/web_midi_test/
