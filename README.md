# Web MIDI test

Test connecting the browser to Bitwig using Web MIDI and using Javascript to control it.

### Windows

Create a virtual MIDI port using loopMIDI.
Start Bitwig which auto-detects the port as a controller. Or at least it did in my case; you may need to add it manually.
Start the test here: https://op12no2.github.io/web_midi_test/
