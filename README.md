# Web MIDI playground

A little Web MIDI playground for testing and evaluating connecting a browser to a DAW/synth etc. and then using Javascript to control it.

I used Windows and Bitwig:-

- Create a virtual MIDI port using loopMIDI. Leave it at the default port name.
- Start Bitwig which auto-detects the port as a controller. Or at least it did in my case; you may need to add it manually.
- Start the playground: https://op12no2.github.io/webmidi_playground/
